# **THE CLOUD FACTORY**
Orientierungsprojekt

## **insight**
The sky is taking up a huge part of our eyesight, affects our life, 
but it always stays an untouched.

## **idea**
I want to make the experience of touching the sky. 

## **execution**
An installation, which brings the sky down to the human level. 
A room, where you can meet the clouds, that are above you.

USER EXPERIENCE:
1. You are standing in the que in front of the exhibition. (yes, there is a que.)
A nice stranger asks you, to look for an image about a cloud in your phone, and send it to a cloudy email address. You find a nice picture about a cloud that you took on your last holiday and send it. Or you just take a photo of the current sky, that is also fine. 
2. You enter the exhibition. It's a huge blue space, with blue chimneys growing out of the ground, and with little clouds flying above them. There are clouds slowly moving on the screens on the walls as well. Oh, wait, one of them is your cloud. 
3. You hang out with your pet cloud, and happily visit other people's cloud. 

HOW IS IT WORKING?
