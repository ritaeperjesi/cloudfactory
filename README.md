# **THE CLOUD FACTORY**
Orientierungsprojekt

### **insight**
The sky is taking up a huge part of our eyesight, affects our life, 
but it always stays an untouched.

### **idea**
I want to make the experience of touching the sky. 

### **execution**
An installation, which brings the sky down to the human level. 
A room, where you can meet the clouds, that are above you.

## **IDEAL/FUTURE CASE: The cloud zoo**

**USER EXPERIENCE:**
1. You are standing in the que in front of the exhibition. (yes, there is a que.)
A nice stranger asks you, to look for an image about a cloud in your phone, and send it to a cloudy email address. You find a nice picture about a cloud that you took on your last holiday and send it. Or you just take a photo of the current sky, that is also fine. 
2. You enter the exhibition. It's a huge blue space, with blue chimneys growing out of the ground, and with little clouds flying above them. There are clouds slowly moving, they are projected on the walls. Oh, wait, one of them is your cloud. 
3. You hang out with your pet cloud, and happily visit other people's cloud. 

**HOW IS IT WORKING?**
1. A software analizes the picture and finds where are the white and blue pixels, and in which proportion are they.
2. It created a 3D particle system object with a shape that resembles, with the shape of the 2D image.
3. The 3D object is projected in 3d with 3 projectors on a fog, coming from the chimney-fogmachine.

4. The 3D object is also shown on the wall in 2D, and it is slowly moving across the room.
5. Each time a new cloud comes, they are collected on the screens, the 3D clouds are the most recent clouds. 
6. By the way, there is some fog on the level of the floor, as you were standing on a cloud.

## **SLIGHTLY MORE REALISTIC BEST CASE: Appointment with your cloud**

**USER EXPERIENCE:**
1. You send an image about your cloud.
2. You enter a smaller and darker room, where there is one chimney, and your cloud is hanging out in 3D above it. 
3. There are other clouds on the screens around you.
4. There is some fog on the floor level.

## **WORST CASE: Just 3 clouds**

**RITA EXPERIENCE:**
1. Because of the zombie apocalipse, I've lost a lot of time, but luckily I saved my life and my computer. I still try to find some beauty in life, so I do the cloud project in smaller scale.
2. There are no more clouds, so people can't send me clouds. Or things don't work with finding clouds on the images. 
So I'll decide to make 3 cloud architypes of the clouds: a cirrus, a cumulus and a magical random cloud.
I find the way to generate these clouds in 2D.
4. The zombies destroyed the last fog machine as well, OR I just can't project 3d stuff on fog, so I display these clouds on the walls. 

**USER EXPERIENCE:**
So you are in this space, surrounded by projections of different pretty clouds around you. If the zombies left some fog machine, there is some fog on the ground.
