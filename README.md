# **THE CLOUD FACTORY**
Orientierungsprojekt

### **insight**
The sky is taking up a huge part of our eyesight, affects our life, 
but it always stays an untouched.

### **idea**
I want to make the experience of touching the sky. 

### **execution**
An installation, which brings the sky down to the human level. 
A room, where you can meet the clouds, that are above you.

## **IDEAL/FUTURE CASE: The cloud zoo**

**USER EXPERIENCE:**
1. You are standing in the que in front of the exhibition. (yes, there is a que.)
A nice stranger asks you, to look for an image about a cloud in your phone, and send it to a cloudy email address. You find a nice picture about a cloud that you took on your last holiday and send it. Or you just take a photo of the current sky, that is also fine. 
2. You enter the exhibition. It's a huge blue space, with blue chimneys growing out of the ground, and with little clouds flying above them. There are clouds slowly moving, they are projected on the walls. Oh, wait, one of them is your cloud. 
3. You hang out with your pet cloud, and happily visit other people's cloud. 

**HOW IS IT WORKING?**
1. A software analizes the picture and finds where are the white and blue pixels, and in which proportion are they.
2. It created a 3D particle system object with a shape that resembles, with the shape of the 2D image.
3. The 3D object is projected in 3d with 3 projectors on a fog, coming from the chimney-fogmachine.

4. The 3D object is also shown on the wall in 2D, and it is slowly moving across the room.
5. Each time a new cloud comes, they are collected on the screens, the 3D clouds are the most recent clouds. 
6. By the way, there is some fog on the level of the floor, as you were standing on a cloud.

## **SLIGHTLY MORE REALISTIC BEST CASE: Appointment with your cloud**

**USER EXPERIENCE:**
1. You send an image about your cloud.
2. You enter a smaller and darker room, where there is one chimney, and your cloud is hanging out in 3D above it. 
3. There are other clouds on the screens around you.
4. There is some fog on the floor level.

## **WORST CASE: Just 3 clouds**
